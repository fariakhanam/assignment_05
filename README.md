3.What is Event Bubbling and how does it work?
Event bubbling means when we add any event happend like click or others it firstly works the inside of it and it  spreads from the inside to the outside. 
it works:
When  clicked the child button, the event starts at the child element 
Then the event bubbles up to the parent div 
It can continue to bubble up to the body, document.

4.What is Event Delegation in JavaScript? Why is it useful?
Event Delegation is a technique in JavaScript where instead of attaching event listeners to multiple child elements, attach a single listener on a parent element. Then  use (event.target)
to determine which child triggered the event.
it is useful because of simpler code, less memory usages and dynamic elements.

5.What is the difference between preventDefault() and stopPropagation() methods?

preventDefault() : It 	stops the browserâ€™s default action but not stop bubblings
stopPropagation() : It stops the event from reaching parent elements that's mean it prevents bubbling but does not prevent the default browser behavior.
